# Termination Screenshots
Screenshots from our study where we terminated accounts on 20 Social media platforms on Mobile App, Desktop Web Browser, and Mobile Web Browser (when possible).

Paper to appear in CSCW 2022
Schaffner, B., Lingareddy, N., and Chetty, M. Understanding Account Deletion and Relevant Dark Patterns On Social Media.

There are 321 screenshots in this repo, which is fewer the 490 screenshots reported in the paper. We removed some images for privacy (Slack), removed some duplicate workflows like when multiple researchers deleted the same accounts (on all modalities) to check across iphone-android chrome-safari, etc.
We also removed some screenshots from attempts that did not result in termination, such as Instagram->Mobile.
